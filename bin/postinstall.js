npmlog.info("HPMPostInstall", "Oh one more thing. Remember it's hpm. NOT hsipm! This is because of an NPM Registry thing. HPM was already registered in the database and owned by someone else.\nSo if you wanted to install the droppy addon you do:\nhpm install DroppyAddon\nAnd repeat. Do not run this! hsipm install DroppyAddon since that will not work.\nAnd that's about it. See ya'!")
